# Football Data API Configuration

This file explains how to configure real data sources for your Sports App.

## API Configuration

### 1. Football-Data.org API (Recommended)
1. Go to https://www.football-data.org/client/register
2. Register for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Set environment variable: `FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### 2. API-Football (Alternative)
1. Go to https://www.api-football.com/
2. Subscribe to free tier (100 requests/day)
3. Get your API key
4. Set environment variable: `API_FOOTBALL_KEY=your_key_here`

## Environment Variables Setup

### For Netlify Deployment:
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to Site settings > Environment variables
3. Add the following variables:
   - `FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY` = your_football_data_api_key
   - `API_FOOTBALL_KEY` = your_api_football_key

### For Local Development:
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```
FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY=your_football_data_api_key
API_FOOTBALL_KEY=your_api_football_key
```

## Changes Made

### Demo Data Removal:
- âœ… Removed all `generateDemoMatches()` functions
- âœ… Removed `generateLocalDemoMatches()` function  
- âœ… Removed demo data fallbacks from Netlify functions
- âœ… Removed demo data checks in updateMatchData()
- âœ… Updated error handling to return proper errors instead of demo data

### Real Data Fetching Improvements:
- âœ… Enhanced web scraping with multiple retry strategies
- âœ… Improved HTML parsing with comprehensive patterns
- âœ… Added multiple CORS proxy services for better reliability
- âœ… Enhanced team name parsing with more patterns
- âœ… Improved channel detection with multiple patterns
- âœ… Added proper error handling and debugging
- âœ… Enhanced date pattern matching
- âœ… Improved timeout handling and request reliability

### API Integration:
- âœ… Set up Football-Data.org API integration
- âœ… Set up API-Football integration  
- âœ… Added OpenLigaDB (German leagues) as fallback
- âœ… Proper channel mapping for UK TV channels
- âœ… Enhanced error handling for API responses

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Local Testing:**
   - Open your app locally
   - Check browser console for detailed logs
   - Look for "live-data" source instead of "demo-data"

2. **Netlify Testing:**
   - Deploy the updated code
   - Check Netlify function logs for debugging info
   - Verify API calls are working

## What to Expect Now

- **No more demo data**: App will only show real matches or errors
- **Better error messages**: Clear indication when data fetching fails
- **Multiple data sources**: Web scraping + API sources for reliability
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed logs for debugging issues
- **Improved parsing**: Better detection of matches from live-footballontv.com

## If You See No Matches

This could mean:
1. âœ… **Working correctly** - No actual matches scheduled for today
2. ðŸ”§ **API keys needed** - Configure the API keys as described above
3. ðŸ”§ **Website structure changed** - Check logs for parsing errors
4. ðŸ”§ **Network issues** - Check if the website is accessible

Check the browser console and Netlify function logs for specific error messages.
