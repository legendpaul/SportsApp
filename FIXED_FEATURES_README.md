# 🏆 Sports App - FIXED & ENHANCED

## ✅ **FIXED ISSUES**

Your sports app has been **completely updated** to work properly with:

### 🌐 **Web Scraping (No More API Issues)**

### 📺 **Channel Filter System**
- **Interactive checkboxes** to select which TV channels you want to see
- **Select All / Clear All** buttons for easy management
- **Live filtering** - matches update instantly when you change selections
- **Smart channel parsing** - handles multiple channels per match (e.g., "Sky Sports + Main Event")

### 🐛 **Debug Window**
- **4 debug tabs** showing exactly what's happening:
  - **Web Requests** - HTTP requests to live-footballontv.com
  - **Raw Data** - Parsed match data from website
  - **Filtering** - Channel filter operations
  - **Display Lists** - UI rendering and state changes
- **Real-time logging** - watch the app work in real-time
