# ✅ JAVASCRIPT ERROR FIXED: "this.autoFetchOnStartup is not a function"

## 🐛 **The Problem:**
```
Failed to initialize data manager: this.autoFetchOnStartup is not a function
```

## 🔧 **Root Cause:**
There was a **naming conflict** in the JavaScript code:
- `this.autoFetchOnStartup = true` (boolean property)
- `async autoFetchOnStartup() { ... }` (method)

When the code tried to call `this.autoFetchOnStartup()`, it was trying to call the boolean `true` as a function, which failed.

## ✅ **The Fix:**

### **Changed in both `web-app.js` and `app.js`:**

**Before (broken):**
```javascript
this.autoFetchOnStartup = true; // Property
// ...
if (this.autoFetchOnStartup) {
  await this.autoFetchOnStartup(); // Trying to call boolean as function!
}
```

**After (fixed):**
```javascript
this.shouldAutoFetchOnStartup = true; // Renamed property
// ...
if (this.shouldAutoFetchOnStartup) {
  await this.autoFetchOnStartup(); // Now calls the actual method!
}
```

## 🧪 **Test the Fix:**

1. **Local Test:** Open `error-test.html` in your browser
   - Should show "✅ SUCCESS!" if the fix worked
   - Auto-runs the test when page loads

2. **Main App Test:** Open `index.html` 
   - Should load without JavaScript errors
   - Check browser console (F12) for any errors

## 🚀 **Deploy to Netlify:**

The JavaScript error is now fixed! You can deploy with confidence:

### **Git Method:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix autoFetchOnStartup naming conflict"
git push origin main
```

### **Drag & Drop Method:**
Drag your updated folder to netlify.com (make sure to include the `netlify/` folder with functions)

## 🎯 **What Should Work Now:**

✅ **App loads** without JavaScript errors  
✅ **Auto-fetch** works correctly on startup  
✅ **Live data** fetching via Netlify Functions  
✅ **Real football matches** from live-footballontv.com  
✅ **All features** working as expected  

## 📊 **Files Changed:**

- `web-app.js` - Fixed property naming conflict
- `app.js` - Fixed property naming conflict  
- `error-test.html` - Added test page to verify fix

## 🔍 **Verification Steps:**

1. **Test page**: Visit `/error-test.html` → Should show success
2. **Main app**: Visit `/index.html` → Should load without errors
3. **Console**: Check browser console → No error messages
4. **Function test**: Visit `/function-test.html` → Live data should work
