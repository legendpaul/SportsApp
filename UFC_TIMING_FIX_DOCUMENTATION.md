# UFC Start Times Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Solved âœ…

**BEFORE**: All UFC events had identical hardcoded start times (21:00:00 / 9 PM ET), which was inaccurate because different UFC event types have different broadcast schedules.

**AFTER**: Each UFC event type now has accurate, differentiated start times based on real UFC broadcast patterns.

## Fixed UFC Event Types & Their Accurate Start Times

### 1. ABC/ESPN Cards ðŸ“º
- **Main Card Start**: 8:00 PM ET (20:00)
- **UK Time**: 1:00 AM (next day)
- **Purpose**: Prime-time friendly for mainstream ABC audience
- **Example**: UFC on ABC 6: Hill vs Rountree Jr.

### 2. Fight Night Events ðŸŒ™
- **Main Card Start**: 10:00 PM ET (22:00)
- **UK Time**: 3:00 AM (next day)
- **Purpose**: Late-night ESPN+ streaming audience
- **Example**: UFC Fight Night: Blanchfield vs Barber

### 3. Pay-Per-View (PPV) Events ðŸ’°
- **Main Card Start**: 10:00 PM ET (22:00)
- **UK Time**: 3:00 AM (next day)
- **Purpose**: Premium exclusive timing for maximum impact
- **Example**: UFC 315 (hypothetical)
