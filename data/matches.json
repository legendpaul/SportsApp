The pairing was previously expected to co-headline UFC 303 in last June, but it was scrapped as Rountree withdrew from the event after unintentionally ingesting DHEA in a tainted supplement. On April 1, the pairing was scrapped once again as Hill pulled out due to a lingering leg injury.\r\n\r\nA welterweight bout between Ian Machado Garry and Carlos Prates is now expected to serve as the new event headliner.\r\n\r\nA featherweight bout between Giga Chikadze and David Onama was scheduled for UFC Fight Night: Emmett vs. Murphy, but it was moved to this event for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\nA middleweight bout between Ikram Aliskerov and André Muniz is expected to take place at the event. The pair was originally scheduled to compete at UFC on ESPN: Perez vs. Taira in June 2024, but Muniz withdrew from the bout after he suffered a foot fracture. Subsequently, the bout was rescheduled for UFC Fight Night: Adesanya vs. Imavov in February, but it was cancelled once again as Muniz and his team had visa issues.\r\n\r\nA lightweight bout between Mitch Ramirez and Ahmad Sohail Hassanzada was scheduled for this event. However, Ramirez withdrew from the fight due to an injury and was replaced by Evan Elder. In turn, Hassanzada was removed from the event after being arrested on charges of alleged sexual assault and was replaced by promotional newcomer Gauge Young.\r\n\r\nA featherweight bout between Chris Gutiérrez and John Castañeda is scheduled for this event. They were previously scheduled to compete in a short notice contest at UFC 313 in March, but the bout was scrapped hours before taking place as Castañeda suffered an undisclosed illness.",

      "description": "UFC 316: Dvalishvili vs. O'Malley 2 was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that took place on June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center, in Newark, New Jersey, United States. \r\n\r\nThe event marked the promotion's 11th visit to Newark and first since UFC 302 in June 2024.\r\n\r\nA UFC Bantamweight Championship rematch between current champion Merab Dvalishvili and former champion Sean O'Malley headlined this event. The pairing previously met in September 2024 at UFC 306 in which Dvalishvili captured the title by unanimous decision.\r\n\r\nA UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship bout between current two-time champion (also The Ultimate Fighter: Team Rousey vs. Team Tate bantamweight winner) Julianna Peña and the 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medalist in judo (also two-time PFL women's lightweight tournament champion) Kayla Harrison co-headlined this event.\r\n\r\nA bantamweight bout between former title challenger Marlon Vera and Mario Bautista was scheduled for this event. They were previously expected to meet at UFC Fight Night: Sandhagen vs. Figueiredo in May, but the pairing was moved to this event for unknown reasons. In turn, Vera pulled out in mid May for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by promotional newcomer and former Bellator Bantamweight World Champion Patchy Mix.\r\n\r\nA flyweight bout between Bruno Gustavo da Silva and Joshua Van took place at this event. They were previously scheduled to compete at UFC 313 in March, but Silva had to withdraw due to an injury.\r\n\r\nSerghei Spivac and Shamil Gaziev were expected to meet in a heavyweight bout at UFC Fight Night: Burns vs. Morales. However, the bout was moved to this event due to undisclosed reasons. In turn, Gaziev pulled out due to undisclosed reasons and was replaced by former LFA Heavyweight Champion Waldo Cortes-Acosta.\r\n\r\nA light heavyweight bout between Johnny Walker and Azamat Murzakanov was scheduled for this event. They were originally scheduled for UFC Fight Night: Burns vs. Morales but were moved to this event for unknown reasons. However, Walker pulled out in early May due to injury and was replaced by Brendson Ribeiro.\r\n\r\nFormer interim UFC Middleweight Championship challenger (also The Ultimate Fighter: Team Jones vs. Team Sonnen middleweight winner) Kelvin Gastelum and Joe Pyfer fought in a middleweight bout at this event. They were previously scheduled to meet at UFC on ESPN: Moreno vs. Erceg in March, but the fight was cancelled on the day of the event as Pyfer had to withdraw due to an illness.\r\n\r\nUroš Medić was expected to meet Khaos Williams in a welterweight bout on the preliminary card. However, Medić pulled out in late May due to sinusitis and was replaced by promotional newcomer Albert Tadevosyan. In turn, Tadevosyan did not pass his medical tests, so Williams instead faced another newcomer in Andreas Gustafsson, who was originally scheduled to compete at UFC on ESPN: Gamrot vs. Klein one week before.\r\n\r\nAt the weigh-ins, Ariane da Silva weighed in at 132 pounds, six pounds over the flyweight non-title fight limit. Her bout with Wang Cong proceeded at catchweight and she was fined 25 percent of her purse which went to Wang.\r\n\r\nDuring the event's broadcast, two-time UFC Heavyweight Tournament winner (UFC 14 and UFC 15) Mark Kerr was announced as the next \"pioneer wing\" and final UFC Hall of Fame inductee of this year during International Fight Week festivities in Las Vegas this June.",
